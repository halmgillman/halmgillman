### Hello, I'm Hal ðŸ‘‹
---

- ðŸŽ­ I'm Edinburgh-based, with experience of working on access and participation in the arts, as well as other administrative support roles with local third-sector organisations.
- ðŸŒµ In particular, I feel there is a technical skills drought in these sector, which I'd like to help improve!
- âœ¨ I'm learning more about how to capture, manipulate and present data more effectively from various sources for the improved operation and intelligence of these organisations.
- ðŸ“– At the moment, I'm still a beginner, but am focusing on technologies like ```HTML```, ```Python```, ```R```, ```Shiny```, and ```SQL```.

If you're interested in collaborating on projects in this area of work, let me know; thanks!
