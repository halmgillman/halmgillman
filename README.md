### Hello, I'm Hal ðŸ‘‹
---

- ðŸŽ­ I'm Edinburgh-based, with experience of working on access and participation in the arts, as well as other administrative support roles with local third-sector organisations. I currently work as Data Architecture and Analytics Coordinator at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe Society.
- âœ¨ I'm keen to more effectively utilise data engineering, analytics and storytelling in the sector to improve outcomes and results for artists, venues, and other key stakeholders. In particular, I'm interested in learning about how to improve capture, transformation and presentation of data for the improved operation and capacity of local organisations like the Fringe Society, and to more effectively realise their social and economic goals.
- ðŸ“– At the moment, I have a particular focus on ```HTML```, ```Python```, ```R```, ```Shiny```, and ```SQL```.

If you are interested in this work, or collaborating on Scottish open data projects, I'd really appreciate hearing from you.

Have a great day!
