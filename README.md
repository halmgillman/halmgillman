### Hello, I'm Hal 👋
---

- 🎭 I'm Edinburgh-based, with several years experience working on analytics and engineering projects for arts and travel organisations.
- ✨ I'm keen to more effectively utilise data engineering, analytics and storytelling in the sector to improve outcomes and results for artists, venues, and other key stakeholders. In particular, I'm interested in learning about how to improve capture, transformation and presentation of data for the improved operation and capacity of local organisations like the Fringe Society, and to more effectively realise their social and economic goals.
- 📖 At the moment, I have a particular focus on  ```Python```, ```R```, ```Shiny```, and ```SQL```.

If you are interested in connecting, or working together on a project, I'd really appreciate hearing from you.

Have a great day!
