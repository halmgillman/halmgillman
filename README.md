### Hello, I'm Hal ðŸ‘‹
---

- ðŸŽ­ I'm Edinburgh-based, with experience of working on access and participation in the arts, as well as other administrative support roles with local third-sector organisations.
- ðŸŒµ In particular, I feel there is a technical skills drought in these sectors, which I'd like to help improve in whatever small way I can.
- âœ¨ I'm learning more about how to capture, manipulate and present data more effectively from diffuse sources for the improved operation and capacity of local organisations with principled aims.
- ðŸ“– At the moment, I'm still a beginner, but am focusing on my learning in technologies like ```HTML```, ```Python```, ```R```, ```Shiny```, and ```SQL```.

If you have any useful learning materials or similar to share regarding Scottish open data projects, I'd really appreciate hearing more about them from you! Similarly, if you are interested in collaborating on projects in this area of work, please do let me know; thanks!
